# Titanic-calssification
The Titanic dataset is a classic playground for data scientists 🤓🔬. It involves predicting passenger survival on the ill-fated ship based on various features 🧐. This task falls under the umbrella of classification 🚢📈 in data science, where we aim to assign each passenger to one of two classes: survived or did not survive 🆘❌.

Data scientists employ a variety of machine learning algorithms 🤖🧠 such as decision trees 🌲, random forests 🌳🌳, logistic regression 📈, and support vector machines 📉 to tackle this problem. They preprocess and clean the data 🧹🧼, handle missing values 🕳️, and engineer new features 🛠️ to improve model performance 📈🚀.

Once models are trained and validated, evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure their performance 📊📉. The Titanic dataset serves as a great introduction to classification problems in data science and helps practitioners refine their skills 📚🔍 while exploring the tragic history of the ship 🌊💔
